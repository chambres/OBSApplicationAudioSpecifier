# OBSApplicationAudioSpecifier
The shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+;

You need OBS' Websocket Server enabled. Then, press that shortcut and the window in focus will be used for the input of the [Application Audio Capture plugin](https://github.com/bozbez/win-capture-audio/releases/tag/v2.2.3-beta). 

I have provided an exe but you should build this yourself, just in case.

You will see the app open in the tray. Closing OBS or right clicking the tray app and clicking quit will close both programs.
